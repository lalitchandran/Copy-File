# Copy-File
## AIM:
To write a python program for copying the contents from one file to another file.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Load the CSV into a DataFrame.

### Step 2: 
 Print the number of contents to be displayed using df.head().


### Step 3: 
The number of rows returned is defined in Pandas option settings.

### Step 4:  
Check your system's maximum column with the pd.options.display.max_column statement.

### Step 5: 
Increase the maximum number of rows to display the entire DataFrame.

## PROGRAM:
`````
